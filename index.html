               <p class="texts">There were no concrete information regarding the state of constitution in the pre-colonial Philippines.

The only form of ruling or political polity during this era were datus, rajahs and lakans and sultans and they ordinarily get their position by inheritance, but one could likewise turn into a datu through display of his ability and bravery in fight, or by demonstrating his initiative aptitudes or different attributes helpful for the barangay's endurance.
They were entrusted with everything therefore ruling with absolute power.
Sometimes several Barangays band together to form an apex city, some of this example were in Maynila, Tondo, the Madja-as of Panay, Pangasinan, Cebu, Bohol, Butuan, Cotabato, and Sulu.

Through analyzation of available information, I have come to a guess that the earliest form of constitution in a pre-colonial Philippines would be the merging of Barangay states, the head ruler being the senior and the most respected datu and others being secondary rulers under him.</p>

                <h1 class="Era">Spanish Era</h1>
                <p class="texts">The Spanish colonization era brought down a myriad of catastrophes upon the Philippines’ Constitutional state. As stated by Rizal, the Filipinos used to be more independent—brimming with culture, just before the Spaniards had colonized us.  

                    At this era, the constitution of the Philippines alone could arguably have been considered to be almost non-existent. This was due to the fact that a lot of the Spanish authorities had taken control of the dominance over most of the constitutional areas of the Philippines.

                        <li>The friars' power could almost rival the Philippines' constitution, due to the evangelization of the Filipinos.</li>
                        <li>The Philippines' constitution was arguably considered to be less independent, as it got overshadowed by the Spaniards' own constitution.</li>
                       
                        <li>Concerning the previous statement, the Philippines' constitution attempted to deprive the friars of their power-- though unfortunately, the friars were able to take advantage of the cavite mutiny-- enabling them to gain their leverage back.</li>

                <h1 class="Era">American Era</h1>
                <p class="texts">Filipinos initially saw their relationship with the United States as that of two nations joined in a common struggle against Spain. However, the United States later distanced itself from the interests of the Filipino insurgents. Emilio Aguinaldo was unhappy that the United States would not commit to paper a statement of support for Philippine independence. The islands were ceded by Spain to the United States alongside Puerto Rico and Guam as a result of the latter's victory in the Spanish–American War. A compensation of US$20 million was paid to Spain according to the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris. Relations deteriorated and tensions heightened as it became clear that the Americans were in the islands to stay.</p>
                  <h1 class="Era">The First Philippine Constitution</h1>
                    <p class="texts">The Philippine Republic, more commonly known as the First Philippine Republic or the Malolos Republic, was a nascent revolutionary government in the Philippines. It was formally established with the proclamation of the Malolos Constitution on January 21, 1899, in Malolos, Bulacan, and endured until the capture of President Emilio Aguinaldo by the American forces on March 23, 1901, in Palanan, Isabela, which effectively dissolved the First Republic.</p>
                    <p class="texts">The First Philippine Republic was established after the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire (1896–1897) and the Spanish–American War between Spain and the United States (1898). Following the American victory at the Battle of Manila Bay, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines, issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898, and established a revolutionary Philippine government. In December 1898, Sovereignty over the Philippines was transferred from Spain to the United States in the 1898 Treaty of Paris, making the United States formally the Philippines colonial power. The Malolos Constitution establishing the First Philippine Republic was proclaimed the following month. The Philippine–American War began in February 1899, which the Philippine Republic lost.</p>
                    <p class="texts">The Philippine Republic was the first constitutional republic in Asia. Although there were several Asian republics predating the First Philippine Republic for example, the Mahajanapadas of ancient India, the Lanfang Republic, the Republic of Formosa or the Republic of Ezo, the Republic at Malolos was the first to frame a comprehensive constitution duly approved by a partially elected congress.</p>
               	<h1 class="Era">The 1935 Constitution</h1>
                <p class="texts">The draft of the constitution was approved by the convention on February 8, 1935 and ratified by Pres. Roosevelt in Washington D.C on March 25, 1935. Elections were held in September 1935; Manuel L. Quezon was elected as the president of the Commonwealth. The 1935 Constitution provided the legal basis of the Commonwealth Government which was considered a transition government before the granting of the Philippine independence with American-inspired constitution; the Philippine government would eventually pattern its government system after American government. It has been said that the 1935 Constitution was the best-written Philippine charter ever.</p>
                <h1 class="Era">The Jones Act</h1>
                <p class="texts">Jones Act, formally Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916, statute announcing the intention of the United States government to “withdraw their sovereignty over the Philippine Islands as soon as a stable government can be established therein.” The U.S. had acquired the Philippines in 1898 as a result of the Spanish–American War; and from 1901 legislative power in the islands had been exercised through a Philippine Commission effectively dominated by Americans. One of the most significant sections of the Jones Act replaced the Commission with an elective Senate and, with minimum property qualifications, extended the franchise to all literate Filipino males. The law also incorporated a bill of rights.</p>

                    The new Charter was ratified in 1943 by an assembly of named provincial members of Kalibapi, an organisation set up by the Japanese to replace all previous political parties, upon the approval of the draft by the Committee. The Second Republic was officially declared (1943-1945) upon ratification by the Kalibapi assembly. On October 14, 1943, José P. Laurel was elected President by the National Assembly and sworn into office.

                    Strong executive powers were provided for by the 1943 Constitution. The Legislature consisted of a unicameral National Assembly and only those deemed to be anti-US were allowed to stand for election, while most members were appointed rather than elected in practice.</p>

President Marcos then issued the Presidential Decree No. 86 which instituted the “Citizen’s Assemblies” in order to ratify the newly drafted constitution in means of a Viva Voce or oral voting, the assembly ran from January 10 – 17, 1973. On January, 17, 1973, President Marco issued the Proclamation No. 1102 which proclaimed that the new constitution was officially ratified by the Filipino people and thereby was in effect.</p>
                <p class="texts"> The 1973 Constitution provides the shift from presidential to parliamentary system of government. President Marcos abolish the congress in favor of the National Assembly for legislative power. A Prime Minister is elected among the National Assembly which serves as the commander-in-chief of the Philippine Armed Forces and the head of the government. The President is elected among the members of the National Assembly and serves as the symbolic head of state with a six-year term with unlimited number of terms. The judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court which composed of a Chief Justice and 14 justices, which was appointed by the Prime Minister, along with the judges of the lower courts. The Constitution retains the independence of the Commission of Elections (COMELEC) and also creating the Civil Service Commission (CSC), the Commission on Audit (COA), three of which composes of the current constitutional bodies, as well as the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA).
                    The Constitution was amended four times:

                    <li>The 1981 amendment replaced the parliamentary system to a semi-president system and provided:

                <p class="texts">Sixty (60) days after the proclamation of the 1986 Freedom Constitution, the Constitution Committee, composed of forty-eight (48) members from different backgrounds, began drafting for a permanent constitution. Several issues arose from the committee such as the form of government system to adopt, the abolition of death penalty, the retention of U.S. bases from Clark and Subic, and the integration of the economic policies to the constitution. Three of the delegates, one of them is Lino Brocka, a film director, resigned before the completion of the constitution. The draft was finished on October 12, 1986 and was ratified after a national plebiscite was conducted on February 2, 1987, which was celebrated as the “Constitution Day” in the Philippines. President Aquino then issued Proclamation No. 58, thus implementing the 1987 Constitution.</p>
                   <h1 class="Era">The Constitution highlights the following:</h1>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The presidential term is a single one in six (6) years.</li>
                    <li>Provided the three (3) government branches, namely: The Executive, The Legislative, and The Judicial branch.</li>
                    <li>The president may declare martial law for only 60 days, the congress may reject the declaration or extend it.</li>
                    <li>The removal of the office of the Prime Minister and the Batasang Pambansa, the unicameral legislation.</li>
                    <li>Multi-party elections are now being held.</li>
